In this we use chain method and devision method hash function. As we can see depend on the text file
the no of keys in the bucket is changed that beacuse words are slitely different.Also when we incrasing
the no of bucket N ,the average no of keys and standrd devition is decreasing but max no of keys in a bucket
is not going to change that means words are not equaly distributed through the bucket so hash function 
and method is not so good.Also changing the hash function is not effected much to the values in this case
